This library represents the abstractions core tools uses for defining commands, environment, process reaper, etc.
The files within this library are based off the .NET sdk [here](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk).

 Once the dotnet cli utils package is in a published consumable state, we will migrate over to use that.
