# Azure Functions CLI: Python templates workload

This package ships function-scaffold templates for Python Azure
Functions projects (v1 and v2 programming models), consumed by the
`func` CLI's `func new` command. It is a **content workload**
(Workload Spec §3; Templates Workload Spec §4.1): the package carries
template files only, with no entry-point assembly and no runtime
services. `func new` resolves the install directory by package id and
reads the template payload directly.

The workload pkg version is independent of the source bundle version
(Templates Workload Spec §4.4.1). The channel a workload was built
from is encoded in the pkg version's prerelease label, and that
channel maps 1:1 to an extension-bundle id (Templates Workload Spec
§4.4.2):

| Channel       | Workload pkg version   | Bundle id                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| stable        | `1.0.0`                | `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle`                        |
| preview       | `1.0.0-preview`        | `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Preview`                |
| experimental  | `1.0.0-experimental`   | `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Experimental`           |

The bundle id is both the upstream extension bundle the workload's
templates were snapshotted from at build time and the value `func new`
expects in the project's `host.json` `extensionBundle.id` at scaffold
time. Channel selection at `func new` is implicit — derived from the
project's `host.json` bundle id.

## Bundle compatibility

This workload declares a minimum compatible extension-bundle version
(`[4.0.0,)`). `func new` validates the project's resolved bundle
version against this constraint and surfaces incompatibilities as a
warning or error (Templates Workload Spec §4.4.4). The constraint is
recorded in three locations that all derive from the single
`$(MinBundleVersionRange)` MSBuild property, so they cannot drift:

- `tools/any/content/templates-workload.json` — CLI-owned sibling
  manifest. Authoritative. Generated at pack time by the
  `GenerateTemplatesWorkloadJson` target.
- Nuspec `minBundle:[4.0.0,)` tag — discoverable via
  `func workload search` / `list`.
- Nuspec `<description>` sentence — surfaced by `func workload list`.

## Install

```bash
func workload install Azure.Functions.Cli.Workloads.Templates.Python@1.0.0
# or by alias
func workload install templates-python@1.0.0
```

Preview / experimental channels resolve via the matching prerelease
label:

```bash
func workload install templates-python@1.0.0-preview
func workload install templates-python@1.0.0-experimental
```

Multiple templates versions coexist via `--force` (Workload Spec §4.6).

## Build-time channel selection

The source bundle id used at pack time is driven by
`$(TemplatesChannel)` in `Directory.Version.props`:

```bash
dotnet pack ... /p:TemplatesChannel=preview
dotnet pack ... /p:TemplatesChannel=experimental
```

`$(SourceBundleVersion)` selects the bundle version whose
`StaticContent/v1` and `StaticContent/v2` subtrees are snapshotted at
build time. It is recorded as build provenance only; it does not
derive the templates pkg version (Templates Workload Spec §4.4.1).

## Layout

The package places the template payload under `tools/any/content/`,
matching the upstream extension bundle's `StaticContent/v1/` and
`StaticContent/v2/` subtrees with the `StaticContent/` wrapper
stripped (Templates Workload Spec §5.2). Python ships both
programming-model subtrees:

```
<workload-home>/workloads/azure.functions.cli.workloads.templates.python/<version>/
  tools/any/content/
    templates-workload.json      ← min-bundle sibling manifest
    v1/                          ← legacy programming model
      bindings/bindings.json
      resources/Resources.json
      resources/Resources.<locale>.json
      templates/templates.json   ← Template[] with files inline
    v2/                          ← v2 programming model
      bindings/userPrompts.json
      resources/Resources.json
      resources/Resources.<locale>.json
      templates/templates.json   ← NewTemplate[] (jobs/actions)
  workload.json
```

Template files are carried **inline** inside each `Template` /
`NewTemplate` entry's `files: { <filename>: <contents> }` map; there
are no separate per-template file directories on disk (Templates
Workload Spec §5.2). v1 templates may reference prompt ids defined in
`v2/bindings/userPrompts.json` — the prompt catalog is unified across
model versions. `tools/any/` is the canonical content-workload payload
path.
