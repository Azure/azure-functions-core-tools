# Repository Structure

This document describes the Azure Functions Core Tools v5 codebase — projects, build system, CI, and how everything fits together.

## Overview

The v5 CLI is built with [System.CommandLine](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api) and [Spectre.Console](https://spectreconsole.net/), targeting **.NET 10**. It is being designed around a **workload model** (similar to the `dotnet` CLI) where the base CLI provides core commands and infrastructure while language-specific functionality (templates, init, pack) is delivered via independently installable workload packages. The base CLI and the abstractions library are in the tree today; the workload runtime + first-party workload packages are being staged in follow-up PRs.

## Projects

### `src/Func.Cli` — The CLI Executable

The main tool users install and run. Assembly name is `func`.

| Directory         | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------|
| `Commands/`       | All CLI commands (init, new, pack, start, version, help) + `BaseCommand`, `FuncRootCommand`, `ProjectDetector`, `SpectreHelpAction` |
| `Console/`        | `IInteractionService` abstraction + Spectre.Console implementation, theme |
| `Common/`         | Shared utilities — `Constants`, `Stacks` (stack registry), `VersionChecker` |
| `Telemetry/`      | `CliTelemetry` (ActivitySource + Meter), Azure Monitor exporter wiring, activity / metric extensions |
| `Program.cs`      | Entry point — telemetry setup, command tree, error handling |
| `Parser.cs`       | Command tree composition — registers all commands, wires Spectre help |

### `src/Func.Cli.Abstractions` — Workload Contracts

A packable NuGet library (`Azure.Functions.Cli.Abstractions`) intended to host the public types that workload authors will reference. Workload authors will reference this package — they will never reference `Func.Cli` directly.

Today it contains:
- **`GracefulException`** — User-friendly exception used by the CLI (and, eventually, by workloads) to surface a primary message plus optional verbose detail and to drive a non-zero exit code.

The remaining workload extension types (`IWorkload`, `IProjectInitializer`, `ITemplateProvider`, `IPackProvider`, related context records) are being added in follow-up PRs.

## Build System

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `global.json` | Pins .NET SDK 10.0.100, allows prerelease |
| `Directory.Build.props` | Defines `RepoRoot`, `ArtifactsPath=out/`, publish/package paths |
| `Directory.Build.targets` | Imports `eng/build/Engineering.targets` |
| `Directory.Packages.props` | Enables Central Package Management, imports `eng/build/Packages.props` |
| `eng/build/Packages.props` | Pins all NuGet package versions centrally |
| `eng/build/Telemetry.props` | Injects telemetry instrumentation key as assembly attribute |
| `src/Directory.Build.props` | Sets `IsPackable=true`, package output to `out/pkg/` |

Each project also has its own `Directory.Version.props` for independent versioning.

### Build Commands

```bash
dotnet restore                          # Restore packages
dotnet build                            # Build all projects in the solution
dotnet test                             # Run all tests
dotnet publish src/Func.Cli/            # Publish CLI for distribution
```

### Output Structure

```
out/
├── bin/          # Build output (per-project subdirectories)
├── pub/          # Publish output
└── pkg/          # Package output
```

## CI Pipelines

Each component has its own CI pipeline with **path-scoped triggers**, enabling independent build and release cadences.

| Pipeline | File | Triggers On |
|----------|------|-------------|
| CLI public build | `eng/ci/cli-public-build.yml` | PRs touching the CLI, nightly schedule |
| CLI official build | `eng/ci/cli-official-build.yml` | Release branches |
| Abstractions public | `eng/ci/abstractions-public-build.yml` | PRs touching `src/Func.Cli.Abstractions/` |
| Abstractions official | `eng/ci/abstractions-official-build.yml` | Release builds, NuGet pack |
| Code mirror | `eng/ci/code-mirror.yml` | Mirror to engineering repo |

## Test Patterns

- **Framework**: xUnit + NSubstitute
- **`TestInteractionService`**: In-memory `IInteractionService` that captures all output and returns deterministic values for prompts
- **Temp directories**: Tests that touch the filesystem create temp dirs and clean up via `IDisposable`

```bash
dotnet test                             # All projects
dotnet test test/Func.Cli.Tests/        # CLI tests only
```

## Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Stable v4 release branch |
| `vnext` | Base branch for v5 development |
| `liliankasem/workloads/*` | Stacked PRs landing the v5 workload extensibility model |
